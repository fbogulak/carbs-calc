# Carbs Calc

This app is created to help diabetics in their daily carb counting routine.

If you want to calculate how much carbs is for example in your slice of bread, type the weight of your portion (eg. 36) and amount of carbs it contains in 100 g (eg. 43). The result (15.48 g in this case) shows immediately.

And if you want to eat eg. 40 g of carbs in the bread, you can just switch to the second tab and type "40". The result is the weight of bread you should eat.
